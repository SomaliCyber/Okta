# Okta Professional Certification Prep
This repository contains the materials that I used to prepare for the Okta Professional Certification. The certification is designed to demonstrate knowledge of secure identity management and mobility concepts. It is a valuable credential for IAM security engineers who want to demonstrate their skills and knowledge to potential employers.

The repository is organized into the following folders:

Courses: This folder contains the course materials for the courses that I took as part of my preparation.
Practice exams: This folder contains practice exams that I used to test my knowledge of the material.
Notes: This folder contains my own notes and study materials.
Projects: This folder contains the projects that I worked on as part of my preparation.
Blog posts: This folder contains blog posts that I wrote about my journey to obtaining the certification.
I hope that this repository will be helpful to others who are preparing for the Okta Professional Certification.
